<h4>Purpose</h4>

Here, i used perspective to generate a live graph that displays the data feed in a clear and visually appealing way for traders to
monitor.<br>
<br>
Recalling that the purpose of this graph is to monitor and determine when a trading opportunity may arise as a result of the
temporary weakening of a correlation between two stock prices, the trader should be able to quickly and easily
notice when the ratio moves too far from the average historical correlation. In the first instance, we'll assume that threshold is
+/-10% of the 12-month historical average ratio.

<h4>Ticket Acceptance Criteria</h4>
This ticket is done when the numbers from the python script render properly in the live perspective graph. <br>
<br>
This means the
ratio between the two stock prices is tracked and displayed, the upper and lower bounds are shown on the graph, and an
alert is shown whenever the bounds are crossed.
